# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "I construct theoretical models of the founding, failure, and growth of organizations that, when combined, constitute an explanation of the process by which the number of organizations in a population (the population density) declines from a peak, while at the same time the population mass (the aggregate size of the organizations in the population) continues to increase. Empirical results from analyses of the vital rates of credit unions in New York City are generally supportive of the models. The results of computer simulations are consistent with empirically observed trajectories of density and mass for the credit union data."
